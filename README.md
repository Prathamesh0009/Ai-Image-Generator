# Ai Image Generator Project using OpenAi API

This website works like Midjourny and DALL-E
If you’re unfamiliar, Midjourny and DALL-E are AI image-generation websites. They use a machine-learning model to create images based on text descriptions. Users can input their desired image prompt, and these websites will generate a corresponding image that matches the description.

On this custom AI image generation website, users enter their prompt, choose the number of images they want to generate, and click the “Generate” button. The AI will then create images based on the user prompt. To download each image, the user can click on the corresponding download button provided.
